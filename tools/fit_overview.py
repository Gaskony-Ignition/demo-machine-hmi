WHAT WAS WRONG

Measured on the rendered page at 1443x541, eighteen pairs of text boxes
overlapped. They were not random - they were the same mistake repeated.

A zone card is 233 x 61 px. Stacked inside it: an 11.5px zone name, a 10px
state word, a 26px counter and a 9.5px caption. That is about 65px of type
plus padding in 61px of card, so every row's box ran into the row below it.
The rows still read, because a label's text is smaller than the line box it
sits in - but there was no space anywhere and the card looked jammed, which
is exactly what it was.

The same thing in the sensor panel: the photo-eye captions occupy a box 5px
tall holding 13px of text, and the gate captions sit in the next 5px box
down. "Length 1" and "GATE 1 DOWN" genuinely collided - the first ends at
x=340 and the second starts at x=329.

WHAT CHANGES

1. The state word moves up beside the zone name, right-aligned, instead of
   taking a row of its own. That is a row back for free, and it matches the
   pattern the right-hand rail already uses.

2. Z5's state was 20px where the other four were 10px - the same word at two
   sizes on one screen. All five are 10px now.

3. The cards get taller: 0.175-0.450 becomes 0.155-0.470 of the mimic, 61px
   to 69px at this window. The space comes from the gaps either side, which
   were 10px and 9px and are now 5px and 4px - the cards have borders, so
   they do not need a wide moat to read as separate.

4. Every label box is now at least as tall as the text in it, and the rows
   are laid out with real gaps between them rather than butted together.

5. The gate and clamp captions move to their own row under the photo-eye
   captions, and get enough width for their text at 1024 as well
   ("GATE 1 DOWN" needs 61px and had 50).

6. "Interfaces" in the safety row no longer overlaps the air-pressure
   readout beside it.

Every number below was measured on the live page, not estimated. The card
fractions are of a 69px card; the sensor fractions are of an 87px panel.
